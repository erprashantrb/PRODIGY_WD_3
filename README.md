# PRODIGY_WD_3
This repository contains an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete by taking turns to place their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get three markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
